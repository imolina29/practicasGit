I am a Quality Assurance professional focused on software testing and automation. 
I have strong experience designing and implementing test automation frameworks using tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, 
Serenity BDD, and Cucumber, along with programming languages including Java, TypeScript, Javascript, and Python. 
I apply design patterns such as Page Object Model and Screenplay to ensure scalable, maintainable, and reliable solutions.

My background covers both manual and automated testing for web, mobile, API, cloud, and AI-driven systems. 
I have also contributed to the definition and improvement of QA processes, including exploratory and regression testing.
